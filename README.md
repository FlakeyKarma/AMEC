##v1.0.0
### Administrator, Management, and Employee Creation

This program is currently just a basic setup with allowing users to follow a basic blueprint for user creation and permission setting.

(AMEC currently just works for Linux, but will be compatible with Windows devices in the futre.)

1 - Supervisors
2 - Employees

Each type has access to types below it, but none have access to types that are equals.
